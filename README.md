# nosu!

## Warning: This sucks and I never want to look at this again. 

A *terrible* clone of the rhythm game "osu!" for a class project. Made with [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/).


Original [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) game made by [ppy](https://github.com/ppy).

Building from source: Just make sure you have [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) and MonoGame extended. Also it turns out I suck at everything so you also need [this osu! beatmap parser library](https://github.com/mrflashstudio/OsuParsers).
